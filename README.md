# BlockExplorer

Since I opted to not build a front end, to run my functions you need to use command line with the following commands:
  >npm run someFunc
  >
  >npm run someFunc2 param  (if a parameter is required)
       


Instructions will print out after each function call



Exported functions: 
  >getCurrentBlock
  >
  >getAccountBalance(address)
  >
  >outputLatestBlockTransactions
  >
  >outputBlockTotalETH(blockHash)
